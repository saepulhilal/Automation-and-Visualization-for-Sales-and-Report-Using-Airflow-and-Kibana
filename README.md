# Automation and Visualization for Sales and Report Using Airflow and Kibana

In this Sales and Marketing project, an in-depth report on the sales performance of Adidas products is presented with data retrieval from PostgreSQL, data cleaning, and automatic processing that results in a push back to PostgreSQL. Implementation of Elasticsearch and Kibana is used for data visualization, facilitating understanding and effective decision making. Additionally, the report explores long-term financial trends, market share among retailers, as well as the effectiveness of various sales methods. Focusing on geographic aspects, best-selling product categories and profitability of Adidas retail operations, this report provides strategic insights to support informed decision making and identify growth opportunities.
